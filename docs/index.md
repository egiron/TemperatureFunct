# Welcome to Temperature Response Functions

This is a small but powerful package for estimating wheat yield under non-stressed and VPD stressed conditions as a function of temperature. Different temperature response functions could predict wheat yield across various locations. The suggested yield algorithm based on different temperature functions could predict wheat yield with high accuracy across various locations around the world.

We analyse how different temperature functions and VPD thresholds affects non-water stress wheat yield across the International Wheat Improvement Network (IWIN) sites and the other locations across the globe. The code generated using python and R programming languages during the project is published in this repository.
