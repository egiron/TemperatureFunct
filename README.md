# Welcome to Temperature Response Functions

This is a small package for estimating wheat yield. it estimates yield under non-stressed and VPD stressed conditions as a function of temperature.

* Azam Lashkari (azam.lashkari@jic.ac.uk)
* Urs Christoph Schulthess (U.Schulthess@cgiar.org)
* Carlo Montes (c.montes@cgiar.org)
* Ernesto Giron E. - (e.giron.e@gmail.com)

Reference:

* _Lashkari et al. Vapor pressure deficit adds little to temperature-based explanations of irrigated wheat yield prediction.
